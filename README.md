# Titanic Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Overview
This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data using statistics and visualizations.

---

##  Steps Performed
- *Summary statistics* for numerical & categorical features.
- *Histograms* for numeric feature distribution.
- *Boxplots* to detect outliers.
- *Pairplot* for feature relationships.
- *Correlation matrix heatmap* to study relationships.
- *Interactive Plotly scatter plot* for deeper exploration.
- *Basic inferences* from visual patterns.
